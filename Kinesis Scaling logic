1. Initial State: 2 Shards
Let’s say we start with 2 shards: Shard A and Shard B.

Shard A covers key range [0–5000].
Shard B covers key range [5001–9999].

STREAM
 ├── Shard A (Open)
 │      Key Range: 0–5000
 │      Data: [ D1, D2, D3, ... ]
 │
 └── Shard B (Open)
        Key Range: 5001–9999
        Data: [ D4, D5, ... ]
Reading and Writing
Producers write new records:
If a record’s partition key hashes into [0–5000], it goes to Shard A.
If the partition key hashes into [5001–9999], it goes to Shard B.
Consumers read from both shards.
2. Scale-Up (Splitting a Shard)
Suppose we notice Shard A is heavily loaded and want to increase overall capacity by adding a new shard. Kinesis does this by splitting one open shard into two open shards.

Example: Split Shard A
We split Shard A’s key range into:
Shard C covering [0–2500]
Shard D covering [2501–5000]
Once the split is triggered:

Shard A transitions to CLOSED (no new writes).
Shard C and Shard D become OPEN for new data.
Any existing data in Shard A is still readable until it ages out, but it’s no longer receiving new records.

STREAM
 ├── Shard A (Closed)
 │      Key Range: 0–5000
 │      Data: [ D1, D2, D3, ... ]  <-- still readable!
 │
 ├── Shard C (Open)
 │      Key Range: 0–2500
 │      Data: [] (initially empty)
 │
 ├── Shard D (Open)
 │      Key Range: 2501–5000
 │      Data: [] (initially empty)
 │
 └── Shard B (Open)
        Key Range: 5001–9999
        Data: [ D4, D5, ... ]
New Writes After the Split
Any new record with a partition key hashing to [0–2500] now goes to Shard C.
Any new record hashing to [2501–5000] goes to Shard D.
Keys [5001–9999] still go to Shard B.
Result:

We went from 2 shards total to 3 shards (B, C, D are open).
Shard A has been “closed”, but data inside A can still be read until it expires (retention).
3. Scale-Down (Merging Shards)
Now imagine we want to reduce the shard count (perhaps we have less traffic). We can merge two adjacent shards (i.e., shards whose key ranges are consecutive).

Example: Merge Shard C and Shard D
We combine their key ranges [0–2500] and [2501–5000] into a new shard, say Shard E with [0–5000].
Once the merge is triggered:

Shard C and Shard D transition to CLOSED.
Shard E becomes OPEN, covering [0–5000].
Old data in C and D remains accessible (readable) until it expires, but no new records go there.

 │
 └── Shard B (Open)
        Key Range: 5001–9999
        Data: [ ... ]
New Writes After the Merge
Any new record with partition key [0–5000] goes to Shard E.
Keys [5001–9999] still go to Shard B.
Result:

We reduced the total shard count from 3 open shards (B, C, D) to 2 open shards (B, E).
C and D are now “closed” but can be read from until data expires.
4. Key Takeaways
Data in Closed Shards is Not Lost:

It’s still readable until it expires by stream retention rules (default 24 hours, can be up to 365 days if configured).
No new records will go into a closed shard.
New Shards Carry the “Open” Key Ranges:

Splits produce multiple new shards covering sub-ranges of the old shard’s key range.
Merges produce a single new shard covering the combined key range of two old shards.
Reading and Writing Moves to the New Shards:

Producers automatically send new records to whichever shard covers the partition key’s hash range.
Consumers using the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) or Lambda event source mapping automatically detect and read from new shards.
By seeing the key ranges and the open/closed states, you can visualize how the old shards remain accessible while the new shards handle fresh writes. This is exactly what happens behind the scenes when you scale the stream by increasing or decreasing the shard count.

Below is a deep-dive on how Amazon Kinesis partition keys are hashed and how that determines which shard a record goes to.

1. The Role of the Partition Key
When you put data into a Kinesis stream (using the PutRecord or PutRecords API), you specify:

The data (the payload).
A partition key (a string).
This partition key is used to decide which shard in the stream will receive that record.

Key idea: If two records have the same partition key, they are guaranteed to go into the same shard (unless a reshard event changes the hash ranges, in which case the same partition key after the split/merge still goes to one specific shard’s new range).
2. MD5 Hashing
Under the hood, Kinesis takes your partition key (a string) and applies the MD5 hashing algorithm. MD5 produces a 128-bit hash value. We can think of this as a number in the range:

0
≤
MD5
(
partitionKey
)
≤
(
2
128
−
1
)
0≤MD5(partitionKey)≤(2 
128
 −1)
In decimal, that’s roughly 0 to 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,455. Kinesis calls that a “hash key” internally.

3. Shard Hash Key Ranges
Each shard in a Kinesis stream is assigned a continuous range of these 128-bit hash key values:

Example: A shard might own the range 
[
0
…
3402823669
]
[0…3402823669].
Another shard might own the range 
[
3402823670
…
6805647339
]
[3402823670…6805647339].
And so on.
When you have multiple shards, each shard has non-overlapping hash key ranges. The entire stream effectively partitions the 0…(2^128-1) range among all its open shards.

Splitting a Shard
If you split a shard, you divide its hash range into two sub-ranges. For example:

Original shard: 
[
0
…
5000
]
[0…5000]
Split into:
[
0
…
2500
]
[0…2500]
[
2501
…
5000
]
[2501…5000]
Merging Shards
If you merge two adjacent shards, you combine their hash ranges:

Shard 1: 
[
0
…
2500
]
[0…2500]
Shard 2: 
[
2501
…
5000
]
[2501…5000]
Merged Shard: 
[
0
…
5000
]
[0…5000]
4. How Kinesis Routes a Record
When you call PutRecord (or PutRecords) with a partition key:

Kinesis calculates md5Hash = MD5(partitionKey) (128-bit number).
It checks which shard’s hash range includes md5Hash.
It delivers the record to that shard.
Example
Let’s say your partition key is "customer123":

Kinesis runs MD5 on the UTF-8 bytes of "customer123". Suppose that yields some 128-bit number, e.g. 217… (shortened).
Kinesis finds the shard that covers the hash range including 217…. Let’s call it Shard A.
Shard A receives the record.
If you put another record with the same partition key "customer123", it also gets hashed to the same 128-bit value, so it goes to the same shard (Shard A). That’s how Kinesis ensures ordering by partition key within a shard.

5. Consequences and Best Practices
Hot Partitions

If one partition key is used extremely frequently, its shard might become “hot,” receiving a disproportionate share of traffic. This can lead to read/write throttles on that shard.
To avoid this, choose or generate partition keys with better distribution.
Uniform Distribution

Ideally, you want your partition keys to evenly spread the MD5 hashes across the 0…(2^128-1) space, ensuring each shard gets roughly equal load.
Scaling

When you scale up (via UpdateShardCount or manual splits), you break up a large hash range into smaller sub-ranges, so each shard handles fewer partition keys.
When you scale down (merge shards), you combine adjacent hash ranges.
Consumer Ordering

If you need strict ordering of records for a given entity (e.g., a user ID), use that entity ID as your partition key. All records for that user ID will appear in a single shard in order.
Shard Limit

Each shard has a read/write capacity limit. If you exceed it, you get ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. Using multiple shards + well-distributed partition keys helps handle higher throughput.
6. Visual Summary
Imagine the 128-bit hash space as a giant line from 0 to 2^128-1. Suppose your stream has 4 shards:

vbnet
Copy
0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  2^128-1
   [ shard1 ]         [ shard2 ]              [ shard3 ]                  [ shard4 ]

   Let's say:
   shard1 covers [0..10^28], shard2 covers [10^28+1..2*10^28], etc.
Each partition key is hashed with MD5 => a point on this line.
Kinesis sees where the hashed value lies, then routes to the shard that covers that range.
If you split shard2, you subdivide its hash range into two smaller sub-ranges (two new shards). If you merge shard2 and shard3 (if their ranges are adjacent), you unify them into one bigger range.

7. Summary
Partition key 
→
→ MD5 hash 
→
→ Shard (based on the shard’s hash range).
Scaling up = splitting shards = subdividing hash ranges.
Scaling down = merging shards = combining hash ranges.
Good partition key design = more even distribution across shards (avoid hotspots).
Ordering is guaranteed at the shard level for the same partition key.
Thus, the MD5 partition key hash is the heart of how Kinesis determines which shard a particular record goes to, enabling both parallel processing (across multiple shards) and ordering (within a single shard).
